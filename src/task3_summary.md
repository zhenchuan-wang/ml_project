### Training Considerations for Multi-Task Learning

#### Scenario 1: Freeze the Entire Network
- **Implications**: No part of the model is updated during training. This is useful if the pre-trained model already performs well on the tasks, and you only want to use it for inference.
- **Advantages**: 
  - Extremely fast training since no gradients are computed.
  - Prevents overfitting, especially with small datasets.
- **When to Use**: When the pre-trained model is already highly optimized for the tasks, and no further fine-tuning is needed.

#### Scenario 2: Freeze Only the Transformer Backbone
- **Implications**: The transformer backbone remains fixed, but the task-specific heads are trained.
- **Advantages**:
  - Retains the general-purpose features learned by the pre-trained model.
  - Allows the task-specific heads to adapt to the new tasks without altering the shared representations.
- **When to Use**: When the pre-trained model provides strong general-purpose embeddings, but the task-specific heads need to be fine-tuned for the new tasks.

#### Scenario 3: Freeze Only One of the Task-Specific Heads
- **Implications**: One task-specific head is frozen, while the transformer backbone and the other task-specific head are trained.
- **Advantages**:
  - Useful when one task has sufficient data and performance, but the other task needs further tuning.
  - Reduces the risk of overfitting for the frozen task.
- **When to Use**: When one task is already well-performing, and you want to focus on improving the other task.

### Transfer Learning Approach

#### 1. Choice of Pre-trained Model
- **Rationale**: Choose a pre-trained model (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) that has been trained on a large corpus and is known to perform well on a variety of NLP tasks. These models provide strong general-purpose embeddings that can be fine-tuned for specific tasks.

#### 2. Layers to Freeze/Unfreeze
- **Freeze Transformer Backbone Initially**: Start by freezing the transformer backbone to retain its general-purpose features. Train only the task-specific heads to adapt to the new tasks.
- **Unfreeze Backbone for Fine-Tuning**: If performance is suboptimal, unfreeze the transformer backbone and fine-tune the entire model. This allows the backbone to adapt to the specific nuances of the new tasks.
- **Selective Freezing**: If one task has significantly less data, consider freezing its task-specific head to prevent overfitting while fine-tuning the other components.

#### 3. Rationale Behind These Choices
- **Retain General Features**: Freezing the backbone initially ensures that the model retains the general-purpose features learned during pre-training.
- **Adapt to New Tasks**: Fine-tuning the task-specific heads allows the model to adapt to the specific requirements of the new tasks.
- **Balanced Training**: Selective freezing ensures that tasks with limited data do not overfit, while tasks with sufficient data can be fine-tuned effectively.

### Example Training Strategy
1. **Initial Training**:
   - Freeze the transformer backbone.
   - Train only the task-specific heads using a multi-task loss function.

2. **Fine-Tuning**:
   - Unfreeze the transformer backbone.
   - Fine-tune the entire model with a lower learning rate to avoid catastrophic forgetting.

3. **Selective Freezing**:
   - If one task has limited data, freeze its task-specific head during fine-tuning to prevent overfitting.
